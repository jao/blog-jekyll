title: dual wan routers
---
 
<p>I&#8217;m looking for a dual wan router, but since it is for my home network, it must be c-h-e-a-p.</p>
<p>I found a <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=452">D-Link Di-lb604</a> that seems to solve my problems, but it was discontinued, making it harder to find.</p>
<p>Does anyone know about any other router that satisfies my needs?</p>
