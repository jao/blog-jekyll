I'm looking for a dual wan router, but since it is for my home network, it must be c-h-e-a-p.

I found a "D-Link Di-lb604":http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=452 that seems to solve my problems, but it was discontinued, making it harder to find.

Does anyone know about any other router that satisfies my needs?
