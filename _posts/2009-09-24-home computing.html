I’ve always had bigger plans than I should for the computer(s) I have at home, now I’m planning on actually using 3 machines, with 4 screens in my personal computer desk. One of them being a TV.

My initial idea was to use a 13" macbook (with a second monitor) to control 2 other linux machines, one being an application server, and the other one a media server (on a monitor/TV).

Something like this

But I might turn the media server into a hackintosh instead. The app server will be running on an ubuntu jaunty, only accessible via ssh and all that.

After reading more about freenas, it makes me wonder if I should try something with a storage server + media/app server instead… oh well.
