<p>Even if you don't care too much about it, I think you should update your google profile.</p>
<p>Just use this link <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles">http://www.google.com/profiles</a> and edit your personal information&#8230; All I want is to have my friend's birthdays on my google calendar (contacts), without adding it myself :D</p>
