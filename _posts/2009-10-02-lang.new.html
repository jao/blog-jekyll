<p>Well, thanks to Juca, I&#8217;ve joined an online community called <a href="http://www.busuu.com">busuu</a>, which is basically a group of people helping each other to learn other languages.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve decided to learn (or get better) italian, french, german and spanish!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll probably fail miserably, but it&#8217;s rather easy to get started on any of those and a bunch of other languages.</p>
