<p>Well, thanks to Juca, I've joined an online community called <a href="http://www.busuu.com">busuu</a>, which is basically a group of people helping each other to learn other languages.</p>
<p>So I've decided to learn (or get better) italian, french, german and spanish!</p>
<p>I'll probably fail miserably, but it's rather easy to get started on any of those and a bunch of other languages.</p>
