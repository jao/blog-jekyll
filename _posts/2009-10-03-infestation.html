I was in a movie theater, watching a movie, when I realized what was going on, this infestation, small worms that craw inside our flesh, and incubate until they are ready for their next phase&#8230; then they would come out and grow up rapidly&#8230; we had to pull them out, and set them on fire with a zippo ligher, to this moment, my arm still feels weird for having those worms sucking my blood.
this creatures were pretty scary, they were mere worms, thin like spaghetti at their 1st stage, but when burned they would get in the most amazing shapes, spirals mostly, but different ones all the time, i think they do that to avoid burning down completely, since that way they would actually survive, and regenerate really fast.
When they were ready to grow to their second stage, they would freaking grow <span class="caps">FAST</span>&#8230; from a small worm to a cat sized catterpillar in a matter of seconds. I didn't really get to observe another change, but something kept telling me they would get even bigger and stronger.
I saw a young girl, very pretty. I helped her and her 2 brothers to get rid of the worms that were on their bodies, and then a theatrical group was getting ready to storm the theather.
One of the guys really didn't like me, because of our past, something about a girl. I don't really remember.
This guy suddenly tackled me, and during this altercation &#8211; one of the worms that crawled into my arm, grew up, and It was a horrible feeling, like I was about to faint, weakness all around, all I wanted was to lay there and sleep.
I imagined that this would be pretty close to actually being bitten by a vampire.
After running around, trying to help people deal with this creatures, we were so tired that we had to rest&#8230; so we all sat down, I put my arm around the young girl, and realized that the guy didn't really like that, so I just removed my arm, and laid back.
and fell asleep, waking up immediately after.
