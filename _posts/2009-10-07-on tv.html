So, most series came back, and some new ones started&#8230;
Here is a list of the series I'm following lately:
  
90210
bones
californication
csi
dark blue
defying gravity
dollhouse
fringe
gossip girl
greek
grey's anatomy
heroes
house
hung
melrose place 2009
ncis
ncis los angeles
smallvile
the big bang theory
the forgotten
the good wife
the vampire diaries
trauma
two and a half men
true blood*

Yeah, a lot of time to watch all of those series&#8230; sadly I'm silly enough to enjoy it.
On top of that I decided to watch all 95 episoes of Rurouni Kenshin, and a few movies that aren't really that good to be mentioned.
