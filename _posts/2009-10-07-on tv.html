<p>So, most series came back, and some new ones started&#8230;</p>
<p>Here is a list of the series I&#8217;m following lately:<br />
90210<br />
bones<br />
californication<br />
csi<br />
dark blue<br />
defying gravity<br />
dollhouse<br />
fringe<br />
gossip girl<br />
greek<br />
grey&#8217;s anatomy<br />
heroes<br />
house<br />
hung<br />
melrose place 2009<br />
ncis<br />
ncis los angeles<br />
smallvile<br />
the big bang theory<br />
the forgotten<br />
the good wife<br />
the vampire diaries<br />
trauma<br />

true blood*</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of time to watch all of those series&#8230; sadly I&#8217;m silly enough to enjoy it.</p>
<p>On top of that I decided to watch all 95 episoes of Rurouni Kenshin, and a few movies that aren&#8217;t really that good to be mentioned.</p>
