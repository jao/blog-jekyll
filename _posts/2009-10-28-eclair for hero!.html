Well, according to <a href="http://www.androidguys.com/2009/10/28/european-htc-hero-skipping-1-6-update/#more-10347">androidGuys</a> HTC will be updating Hero's OS to 2.0, and skipping 1.6
<blockquote>The Hero will not be receiving the Android 1.6 upgrade, it will however get the 2.0 one. Do note however that we do not have a confirmed release date for this upgrade, all I can recommend at the moment is that you keep yourself updated by visiting our website regularly as the latest information will be available to view from there.</blockquote>
We don't know when, let's hope it happens soon.
