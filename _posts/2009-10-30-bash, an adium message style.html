title: Bash, an Adium message style

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-160" title="piece of source code" src="http://jpcamargo.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/bash-code_640x1001.png" alt="bash-code_640x100" width="640" height="100" /></p>

I made this because I always disliked those happy IM windows, with things bouncing around making weird sound effects. It was intially much simpler than this, but a fancy terminal is still good, as long as it is fast, right?

My friends <a href="http://rodrigofranco.com">Caffo</a>, <a href="http://taizasouza.com">Taiza</a> and Juca helped me with this since the beginning, and there is even a Variant (color style) made by Caffo that is in the package -  bu noone likes it.

I've heard that this might <a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2009/05/pidgin-webkit-plugin-adium-conversation.html">work on pidgin</a> too, can someone confirm this? If not what changes do I need to make so this can work?

I plan to only update this to fix bugs now, but if you have any ideas, suggestions or requests, just let me know.

To get this you can go to the <a title="Bash, Adium Xtra - message style" href="http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&amp;xtra_id=3665">Adium Xtras page</a>, or you can get it straight from <a href="http://github.com/jao/Bash.AdiumMessageStyle">GitHub</a>, where you can find more versions as well.
