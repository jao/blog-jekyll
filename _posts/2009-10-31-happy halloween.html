I only wish the celebrations in Brazil would be all that fun, with all the costumes and candy hogging!

But then again I can see how that could be horrible too, the pranks would most likely end in bloodshed or missing limbs to say the least.

Some fun icons I found yesterday, that fit well with the date (<a href="http://iconfactory.com/freeware/preview/liha">source</a>):
