Well, this is a mention of my first website, designed and programmed, using my very own blog tool, blogware. Easier to do that back then, even wordpress was a simple blog tool back then - not a CMS like it is today.

Back in the late 90s, I used to write mostly about my life, but I used this website more to test new technologies, and workarounds, solutions to get things done. I remember that I used a javascript/iframes/php hack to make "ajax"-like calls. And to my knowledge, this site was the very first one to use these emulated calls like that.

I remember how this code used to work, and I remember being kind of cool back then, all of my friends were thrilled by this. Sadly or fortunately, that is nothing special these days.

The php source is even weirder to look at, I miss the recklessness that was programming with sql calls being made from all over the place. I remember a couple years later I started writing my own framework (like every other programmer) and it was pretty solid by the time Ruby on Rails exploded everything with it's simplicity and agility.

I am considering refactoring blogware, well, actually making a new blogware would be more accurate, probably using ruby and RoR, adding some cool web 2.0 features that you can find in current cms/blog tools. And maybe some crazy new things that will be properly used 5 years from now.
