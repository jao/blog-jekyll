Well, what can I say, if the movie was a preview of the future, I would probably die from boredom before the catastrophic events occur - I think I actually took a nap during it.

I guess the whole earth shattering scenes were cool, but oh my god I kept trying to find young <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000704/">Elijah Wood</a> in a motorcycle looking for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005447/">Leelee Sobieski</a> and yelling "Sarah!", which to me already says a lot.

Predictable, boring, exaggerated, and kind of lame - seriously, isn't the earth exploding not enough, the hero and his friends/family need to be half a second away from escaping EVERY single time?

Yet, it met my entertainment expectations. I hated how the ending was all happy and shiny after a freaking cataclysm. I honestly wanted to see a sea monster attacking one of the arks!  I did like the multitude of languages and accents spoken during the movie.
