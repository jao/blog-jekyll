Considering I bought a copy of all warcraft computer games ever released, and that I've been playing Blizzard's games since 1994 when I first got my hands on a <strong>Warcraft: Orcs & Humans</strong> demo (it came in a magazine - back then was a lot harder to buy brand new games here in Brazil). And that I've been subscribed to WoW for the last 5 years (give or take).

I, alone, spent close to $1200 in the last 15 years with this franchise... Congratulations warcraft... I guess.
