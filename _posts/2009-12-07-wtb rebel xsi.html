I am looking for a new camera, and I've set my eyes on the Canon EOS Rebel XSi... It seems to be a good relationship in price x quality. It will be my first real digital slr, so most would agree that going with a canon or nikon is a good idea.

I found it on <a href="http://ebay.com">ebay</a>, with a bunch of accessories and shipping for 1200 usd (taxes not included), and in here - just the camera - for 1800 brl. Then I decided to check <a href="http://bhphoto.com">bhphoto</a>, and the camera with some key accessories plus shipping and taxes* would go for 1700 usd.

It's a hard decision, to be honest, but it seems like traveling to the US and buying it there is not a bad idea, since I can buy some clothes and other smaller things that would make the trip worth it.

I'm just waiting for a reponse from the insurance guy, so see if I can buy my camera in the US and still get it covered by their insurance policy.
