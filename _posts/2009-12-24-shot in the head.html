title: shot in the head
---
 
I was inside a building, the same where we organized the quakenet3 in, helping set up a new infrastructure for some reason. When he-who-shall-not-be-named walks in with a gun (a 9mm to be precise), points the gun to my head - what makes me laugh - and shoots me in the head. It hurts a lot, and I feel something dripping through the whole, but other than the pain (which I woke up with) is really strong.

I start walking away, while other people still repair the electric system, and when I go to the other room, there is a party going on, I meet a girl that only speaks english and we kind of click, and I end up kissing another girl. And I decide to leave.

It is sunny outside, and I meet another friend, emage, that now looks like a basketball player (really tall and strong with a shaved head - I think he was even dressed in similar clothing - when in fact he is skinny, and a little taller than me). He helps me out a lot, and I drive him home (the fact that I was shot still persists).

Sometime later I wake up, and the pain sensation is still there.

Weird.
