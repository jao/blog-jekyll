This was one of the coolest dreams ever, my friend Crash had just moved to a new apartment - close to some sort of dock - and the people that lived there were getting rid of military stuff.

Suffice to say we took some amazing souvenirs, including a helmet from 1946 - that I saved to wear riding the harley I will eventually have, some rifle that I can't name right now - not even sure it was a real one, and a weird bat with the word "japson"(?) written on it.

Oh, did I mention my friend had to wear a chastity belt? Yeah, this was t.m.i. even for a dream.
