In January, a friend and I started a long process of studying the art of the beer. We went through approximately 150 different beers since then, and this last weekend we hosted our first beer tasting event. 

It was a little crash course for a small group of friends, and we served 23 different beers, some were very rare (or at least hard to find), and some were new even to both of us.

We made a simple tasting form for each beer, and gave them to everyone that joined us there.

And a few hours later, all the bottles were empty, people were very happy and surprised with all the details they could now look for anytime they want to try a new beer, or even "judge" one of the many beers they were already used to.

Of course, this whole project will soon become an online catalog, and maybe one day even specific apps for a smartphone or two.
