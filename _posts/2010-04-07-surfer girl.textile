So, I wake up with the phone ringing, I pick up and it's a girl I haven't seen or heard of in the past 15 years. I was so sleepy I couldn't really understand or remember what she was saying. I remember her though, I think her name was Mirella, she was blonde and cute.

I met her back in the day when I used to spend most vacations, holidays and breaks in a beach called 'Guaecá'... I believe she was my friend's cousin's friend, but that is irrelevant.

She was being really nice even if I couldn't understand her, until suddenly the phone started to fail. I figured I should try hitting the handset a couple times when I see a disconnected wire, so I say "the phone is not working, I can't hear you!" while trying to fix it. And 'voi là' I can hear her again and I feel happy about it, still can't get what she is saying though.

Apparently I can't focus well enough to actually listen to her, so I pay attention to the phone instead, and only then I realize two things:
# it was one of those old "rotary phones":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_dial;
# it was a dream...

So I wake up _again_, and start typing this on my phone.
