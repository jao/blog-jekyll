Recently I've heard about <a href="http://twitter.com/mxcl">Max Howell</a>'s <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/"><strong>homebrew</strong></a> and Wayne E. Seguin's <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/"><abbr title="Rails Version Manager"><strong>rvm</strong></abbr></a> from a friend (<a href="http://rodrigofranco.com">caffo</a>), and hearing that they were both pretty cool, I decided to give them a shot.

So if, like me, you are curious about these tools, I'll post what I did to install them.

First I made backups (by moving some folders around)
{% highlight sh %}
mv ~/.gem ~/gems-old
sudo mv /opt/local ~/macports-old
{% endhighlight %}

You could also install a gem called 'rubygems_snapshot' and do a
{% highlight sh %}
gem snapshot export ~/my_gem_list.yml
{% endhighlight %}
or a simple
{% highlight sh %}
gem list > ~/gem_list.txt
{% endhighlight %}
and just plain delete your user gem repository
{% highlight sh %}
rm -rf ~/.gem/
{% endhighlight %}
Of course I am assuming you were installing them in your home directory, why wouldn't you be?

But if by any chance you have gems installed all over the place you could try running this instead (since this would remove the applicable executables as well):
{% highlight sh %}
sudo gem list | awk '{print $1}' | xargs sudo gem uninstall -a -x -i
{% endhighlight %}

Now let's get started.

<h3>Installing homebrew</h3>
"_official installation instructions_":http://wiki.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/installation

Start by running:
{% highlight sh %}
ruby < <( curl 'http://gist.github.com/raw/323731/25f99360c7de3f72027d8fd07cb369b1c8756ea6/install_homebrew.rb' )
{% endhighlight %}
or download it from <a href="http://gist.github.com/323731">here</a> and run it yourself.

If by any chance you don't trust or know what that does, you can test it by running the code below that calls this <a href="http://gist.github.com/385387">simple and safe ruby script</a> first.
{% highlight sh %}
ruby < <( curl 'http://gist.github.com/raw/385387/0cacf4231fceb621c987221ee0aaa380be2bca5d/testing_download_and_run.rb' )
{% endhighlight %}

If you are curious, this is the source of that gist:
{% highlight sh %}
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts 'Hello World'
{% endhighlight %}

Then install <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html">Xcode</a>, I recommend downloading the latest version <ins datetime="2010-04-30T17:45:15+00:00">3.2.2 at this moment</ins> from apple's website.

If you are the only person using your computer, you can change the ownership of <em>/usr/local</em> by doing a:
{% highlight sh %}
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local
{% endhighlight %}

Delete some folders:
{% highlight sh %}
rm -rf /usr/local/include
rm -rf /usr/local/lib
{% endhighlight %}

After that you can start playing around with homebrew i.e.
{% highlight sh %}
brew install wget
{% endhighlight %}
I install most if not all of my stuff from brew now, even mysql and other things that I would rather not get from port.
<strong>Warning: do not remove your system's <em>/usr/bin/ruby</em> since brew depends on it.</strong>

<h3>Let's move to rvm installation now</h3>
(<a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/"><em>official installation instructions</em></a>)

To Install/update from the github repository, which they recommend, run:
{% highlight sh %}
bash < <( curl 'http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head' )
{% endhighlight %}

I had a version of <abbr title="Ruby Enterprise Edition">ree</abbr> installed in /opt, so I just deleted it, I recommend that you do the same.

Add this to your <em>.bash_profile</em> or <em>.bash_rc</em> file, whichever you use.
{% highlight sh %}
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
{% endhighlight %}
They advise you to put it at the end of it, and to make sure you have no <em>return</em>s inside your file.

I have a reload function in my file so I just ran reload
{% highlight sh %}
reload () { source ~/.bash_profile }
{% endhighlight %}
but you have to <em>source</em> again the files you usually load when you open a new terminal.

Now start playing with rvm! Install your rubies!
{% highlight sh %}
rvm install ree
rvm install 1.9.1
rvm install 1.9.2-head
{% endhighlight %}

Set the one you use the most as the default one, at work is ree:
{% highlight sh %}
rvm ree --default
{% endhighlight %}

Everytime you open a new terminal, it should be using the default rvm ruby, but to make you might want to add the rvm-prompt feature to your default PS1. Add <em>~/.rvm/bin/rvm-prompt i v</em> to your PS1 variable, something like:
{% highlight sh %}
# a fancy ps1
export PS1="\e[1;33m\u\e[0m|\e[1;32m\h\e[0m \e[1;34m\w\e[0m |\e[33m$(~/.rvm/bin/rvm-prompt i v)\e[0m|\n\$ "
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to install a gem for all of your rubies run
{% highlight sh %}
rvm gem install gemname
{% endhighlight %}
if not, you just use your regular gem to install stuff (it should be using the specific gem for your chosen ruby - as you can see below).
{% highlight sh %}
$ which ruby
/Users/jao/.rvm/rubies/ree-1.8.7-2010.01/bin/ruby
$ which gem
/Users/jao/.rvm/rubies/ree-1.8.7-2010.01/bin/gem
{% endhighlight %}

I think that sums it up. Have fun!
And ask questions or say if something is wrong in the comments.
