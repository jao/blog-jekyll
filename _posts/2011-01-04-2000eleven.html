A new year has begun, and as usual new commitments are made, new projects are born.

So, following that rule, I hereby promise to try to update this site more often. And here are a few other things I want to do:
<ul>
<li>rebuild my slicehost virtual machine (maybe even change my host service), I've been having issues with the current setup for a long time;</li>
<li><del datetime="2011-03-10T23:19:22+00:00">change the android build of my htc hero® or buy a new mobile device;</del></li>
<li>change the <em>cms</em> from wordpress to one of my own;</li>
<li>finally code my <a href="http://code42.com.br"><em>company's website</em></a> properly - today it is just a single plain html page with 8 lines of css - I'm lazy as hell, I know;</li>
<li>port some projects to rails3, html5 and css3 - even though some of those are not exactly ready;</li>
<li>buy an AT car/truck or a harley davidson fatboy® or start walking a lot;</li>
<li>buy new monitors, and make sure they can use a standard vesa mount so I can put them in the wall and save some desk space (stupid samsung);</li>
<li><s>drink beer</s>;</li>
<li>go to Ireland/England;</li>
<li>drink beer there;</li>
<li>go to Edu's wedding;</li>
<li>drink beer there;</li>
<li>plant a tree;</li>
<li>drink beer there;</li>
<li>find a challenging job;</li>
<li>kill deathwing;</li>
</ul>

And there you go. Let's see how many items of the list above I can actually accomplish...
