A new year has begun, and as usual new commitments are made, new projects are born.

So, following that rule, I hereby promise to try to update this site more often. And here are a few other things I want to do:

* rebuild my slicehost virtual machine (maybe even change my host service), I've been having issues with the current setup for a long time;
* -change the android build of my htc hero® or buy a new mobile device-;
* change the _cms_ from wordpress to one of my own;
* finally code my "_company's website_":http://code42.com.br properly - today it is just a single plain html page with 8 lines of css - I'm lazy as hell, I know;
* port some projects to rails3, html5 and css3 - even though some of those are not exactly ready;
* buy an AT car/truck or a harley davidson fatboy® or start walking a lot;
* buy new monitors, and make sure they can use a standard vesa mount so I can put them in the wall and save some desk space (stupid samsung);
* -drink beer-;
* go to Ireland/England;
* drink beer there;
* -go to Edu's wedding-;
* -drink beer there-;
* plant a tree;
* drink beer there;
* find a challenging job;
* kill deathwing;

And there you go. Let's see how many items of the list above I can actually accomplish...
